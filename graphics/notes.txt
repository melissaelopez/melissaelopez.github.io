Ray Tracing, Shadows, Reflection and Refraction
**********************************************

* How do we account for the shinny-ness

A + Sum ( D * (N • L) + S * pow(E • R, p) ) 
(ambient light color) + (color diffused) * (normal • light source) + (specular component color)
* A = ambient light
* D = unit length vector from the object to the eye
* N = normal
* S = specular component
* The shinnier it is, the larger the power p (which is also a color!)
* R = 2 * N + dot(N,L) - L
* This model isn't actually realistic, so we need to sum all the light sources
* The is the description of a material surface

* Reflections and Shadows are really really easy when you think about how the light source is hitting an object
