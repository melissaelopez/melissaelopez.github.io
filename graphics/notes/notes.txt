 Ray Tracing, Shadows, Reflection and Refraction
*************************************************

* How do we account for the shinny-ness

A + Sum ( D * (N • L) + S * pow(E • R, p) ) 
(ambient light color) + (color diffused) * (normal • light source) + (specular component color)
* A = ambient light
* D = unit length vector from the object to the eye
* N = normal
* S = specular component
* The shinnier it is, the larger the power p (which is also a color!)
* R = 2 * N + dot(N,L) - L
* This model isn't actually realistic, so we need to sum all the light sources
* The is the description of a material surface

* Reflections and Shadows are really really easy when you think about how the light source is hitting an object

 Ray Tracing, Shadows, Reflection and Refraction (continued)
*************************************************************

* interested in the lab? email him: herscher@nyu.edu

* check out the new ray tracing story (should be posted!)
* perlin has added thing to the library
	* you can now store information for all the spheres in uSpheres
	* that's where the spheres are, and they're also being animated by the javascript
* step J adds in the phong shader --> basically makes them look like plastic objects (this is all the math that we went through from Feb. 7) --> go in and break it down
	* make the highlight basically white for plastic, make the highlight closer to the color of the sphere to make it look more like metal
* all the lights are also in the javascript, so in the WebGL code we just loop through however many lights we have
* "u" at the beginning = is uniform, "s" at the end = is an array
* there are couple lights at play (the key light and fill light)
* woah how did he make the glowing pink and orange ones??
* for the third part of the gradient, you want to use (1 - t * t) (if you just use t, then you will get a 50-50 gradient)
* you now need a way for the spheres to reflect the background
* (recall A is ambient light)
* the gradient here is being used in three ways (the background, its reflection on the spheres, and the reflection off one sphere and onto another)
