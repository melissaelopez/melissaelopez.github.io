          This game was my first take at creating a game with
          object oriented programming! Each "mole," or in my
          game's case, each sun, keeps track of its own state
          as being up or down. If it's up, the sun is visible,
          and if it's down, then it is not visible.<br /><br />

          One of the biggest challenges I faced in making this
          game work was keeping track of the state of the game
          from start, to game play, to end. I had already
          implemented a similar state of play from assignment 03,
          however applying it to this game went much more smoothly
          since I knew how to better organize the states with
          separate functions.
