        <h3>Project Proposal:</h3>
        <p>
            We’d like to create an experience where the world is created based on the user’s aura. The way we’d be interested in making this with a Kinect, where the experience alters the displayed world based on the user’s “aura (e.g. depending on how fast they are moving.) For example, if the user is moving really quickly, it senses a RED aura, and enters a red visual space with things that move according to the users motions. If the user moves slowly and fluidly, it senses a GREEN aura, which has a more serene world.<br/></br/>
            We have both been inspired by the game Monument Valley, so we would love to emulate this aesthetic in creating the aura-based worlds, particularly in colors and textures.
            <br /></p>

            <p>
			Rather than recreating the physics and functions of the game, we are using it's graphics for inspiration to create our "aura worlds". Once the program "senses" the user's aura and enters him or her into a world, the user will be able to alter and interact with aspects of the graphical world. I.e. swiping your arm fans infinite diamonds from the visual field, which slowly shrink to nothing.

        <h3>Project Update #1:</h3>
        <p>
            We have our <a href="https://github.com/melissaelopez/aura-reader">code so far hosted on GitHub</a>! So far, we have a webcam application that tracks two differenly colorred markers. The screen turns black when both markers have been selected, which we evntually will have display interesting environments/graphics.
            <br /><br />
            Some issues we are having right now:
            <ul>
                <li>Scaling the canvas/screen capture to the full screen without messing up the rest of the feature tracking logic.</li>
                <li>My portfolio is hosted on GitHub (not i6), so I'm having issues with the webcam apps running on my website.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
